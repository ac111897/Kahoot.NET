# Kahoot.NET Home
Kahoot.NET is a high performance library that can be used to join a Kahoot! game and interact with it as if you were playing the game.
It can be used as an abstraction to build your own web client or it could just be used in the console, or you could extend over it.
<br>
<br>
Whilst the Kahoot.NET.API aims to be close to what the internal representation over at Kahoot would look like, it sometimes will go off course when needed to facilitate performance or for ease of use of the API.
<br>
<br>
As a result of this, this library can be subject to drastic changes to facilitate new features quickly and might need certain changes.
